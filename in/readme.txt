Example parameter files:

- gasonly.par: as its name indicates, this parameter file is for simulations with only gas. It is the most basic parameter file, which doesn't need to specify anything about dust nor the options in the gas energy equation.

- stochturb.par: same as gasonly.par, except that additional options are listed to use the disc turbulent model in Baruteau & Lin 2010 (stochastic excitation of wave-like modes).

- template.par: same as gasonly.par, except that additional parameters are listed to model dust either as Lagrangian particles and/or as a second low- (or zero-)pressure fluid.

- energyeq.par: same as template.par, except that additional options are listed to include the gas energy equation.
