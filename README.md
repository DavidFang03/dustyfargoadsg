# Dusty FARGO-ADSG
Dusty FARGO-ADSG is an extension of the original 2D grid-based hydrodynamical code FARGO. It models the evolution of the gas and dust of a protoplanetary disc with embedded planets, optional energy equation (AD, originally standing for 'adiabatic') and optional gas self-gravity (SG). Dust can be treated either as Lagrangian particles with a power-law size distribution and/or as a zero/low-pressure fluid with fixed size.

Have a look at the quick manual tour (dustyfargoadsg.pdf) to know more about the code's features, how to install, compile and run it!

To post-process the results of Dusty FARGO-ADSG simulations, you can use fargo2python (https://github.com/charango/fargo2python).
